Binned Particle System
=======================

This project implements an advanced particle system using JavaScript, featuring dynamic interactions, collision handling, and mobile responsiveness. It's designed for web developers interested in adding interactive, visually appealing particle effects to their web applications.

This project was inspired by visual artists simon geilfus and yannick jacquet on theyr amazing work: paleodictyon bacteria projected onto centre pompidou metz [reference link](https://www.designboom.com/art/markings-of-paleodictyon-bacteria-projected-onto-centre-pompidou-metz/)

Features
--------

*   **Dynamic Particle Generation**: Generate particles dynamically based on user interaction or predefined settings.
*   **Collision Handling**: Implement efficient collision detection and response mechanisms to simulate realistic particle interactions.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Automatically adjust particle count and behavior based on the device's capabilities, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Utilize spatial partitioning and other optimization techniques to maintain high performance even with a large number of particles.
*   **FPS Debugging**: Include an option to display the current frames per second (FPS), aiding in performance tuning and debugging.
